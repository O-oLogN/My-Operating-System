# My Operating System
_(Apologize for my poor English)_ </br>

Hi! Welcome to my very first OS, which took me 3 fulltime weeks. Today is Sunday, the day I've decided to embark in building this small project 3 weeks ago, and it is also the day I have accomplished the final module of my OS to put it on Git.
## Special thanks
I want to say thank you to: </br>

[OSDev Community](https://wiki.osdev.org) __For great materials about OS and hardware components__ </br>
[Little book about OS](https://littleosbook.github.io/) __For broading my horizon about OS booting process and how hardware components work in x86 architechture__  </br>
[Viktor Engelmann](https://www.youtube.com/@writeyourownoperatingsystem) __For his amazing series about developing OS from scratch__ </br>
[Nanobyte-dev](https://www.youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev) __For the help about setting up components and clean code__ </br>

And also [OSDev Forum](https://forum.osdev.org/), [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com), all blogs I have read, although they are quite old but really helpful for giving me a deeply understand and experiences through the period of 3 nerve-racking weeks.

## What I underwent
Actually, if I take into account the preparing time for _virtual machine_, _environment_, _hunting materials_ _(since I was too new for this thing)_, it should be
about a month. </br> However, the OS was still unfinished and really needs more amount of time _(maybe one more month in developing core things like Memrory Management and File Distribution)_. But let put it aside for a while, I want to save it on my own space, witnessing it as a serie days of failure with bugs and mistakes in designing system, the excitement when pulled off the modules and `Hello from Kernel` line emerged after hopeless efforts. Enjoy my very first OS, I hope you like it :))
