# My Operating System

Hi! Welcome to my very first OS, which took me 3 fulltime weeks. Today is Sunday, the day I've decided to embark in building this small project 3 weeks ago, and it is also the day I have accomplished the final module of my OS to put it on Git.
## Special thanks
I want to say thank you to: </br>

[OSDev Community](https://wiki.osdev.org) __For great materials about OS and hardware components__ </br>

[Little book about OS](https://littleosbook.github.io/) __For broading my horizon about OS booting process and how hardware components work in x86 architechture__  </br>

[Viktor Engelmann](https://www.youtube.com/@writeyourownoperatingsystem) __For his amazing series about developing OS from scratch__ </br>

[Nanobyte-dev](https://www.youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev) __For the help about setting up components and clean code__ </br>

And also [OSDev Forum](https://forum.osdev.org/), [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com), all blogs I have read, although they are quite old but really helpful for giving me a deeply understand and experiences through the period of 3 nerve-racking weeks.

## What I underwent
Actually, if I take into account the preparation time for the virtual machine, environment, and hunting materials (since I was too new for this thing), it should be about a month.

However, the OS was still unfinished and really needed more time (maybe one more month in developing core things like Memory Management and File Distribution). But let's put it aside for a while, I want to save it on my own space, witnessing it as a series of days of failure with bugs and mistakes in designing systems, the excitement when pulled off the modules and Hello from Kernel line emerged after hopeless efforts. Enjoy my very first OS, I hope you like it.
